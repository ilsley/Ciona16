# Ciona 16

The R code underlying the analysis of a scientific paper is hosted here in the interests of reproducibility. The manuscript is undergoing peer review and the code is not properly documented and is being refactored. In the meantime, the code is provided as context for the associated bioRxiv paper.

The code was tested on R 3.4.1 using Bioconductor 3.6 (development version). 

The project has the following directory structure:

| Directory     | Content     |
|:------------- |:------------|
| data-raw      | Data in csv format for importing.  | 
| exports        | Data exported from some of the scripts e.g. the DESeq analysis.  |
| scripts      | R script used for Figure 1, pattern scoring and the DESeq comparison. |
